# Caesar Cipher
This is an implementation of the Caesar cipher in Ruby for The Odin Project

#### Parameters
(String, Number)

#### Returns
String with each character shifted to the right by the given value

## Problems
Implement the famous "Caesar Cipher" that accepts any string, ignores punctuation, preserves case, and loops from one end of the alphabet to the other

## What I used
Ruby strings, arrays, and string methods

## What I learned
- How to iterate over each character of a given string
- How to modify an array using the `map` method
- How to wrap around to the beginning of an array when you reach the end using the `modulo` operator
- How to join multiple strings together
